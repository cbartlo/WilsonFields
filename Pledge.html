	<h2>The Principal's Pledge</h2>
	<p>Dear Wilson High School Community,</p>

	<p>As the school's principal, the co-chair of the Wilson Field Improvement Project committee and as a parent of future WHS students I feel its time for me to do my part in the fund raising that will make this major capital improvement a reality. </p>

	<p>I am making two pledges of support to the project.  The first is a pledge goal made on behalf of the faculty and staff of Wilson High School.  I will ask the teachers, secretaries, administrators, custodians and support staff to join me in raising $2000.  I will get it started by pledging the first $250.  Though $2000 is a modest amount considering the total fund raising goal, it is a significant gesture of support for the project from the staff who have given their lives and talents to the students of this community.</p>

	<p>The second pledge is intended to be a more personal statement of commitment to the goals of the "fields" committee.  I will call it "Run for the Field" for lack of a better name.  I will ask Wilson parents and friends, students- past, present and future- to sponsor ME to run as many laps around the Wilson track as I can until I raise $10,000 for the new field. I think its plausible that I might be able to run 40 laps or 10 miles without causing myself irreparable harm. If every person in the community that sees this project as a "must have" for Wilson agrees to sponsor me even a small amount, say 50 cents a lap, $10K will be easy to reach.  I plan to ask my family and personal friends from Portland and beyond to step up as well to support my goal of adding $10K to this project. </p>

	<p>Taken together these two pledges constitute 1% of the total cost of the field and will hopefully galvanize the greater effort to reach the goal of 1.2 million by this spring.  </p>

	<p>I plan to make my "Run for the Field" on New Year's Eve 2012. That will make your donation tax deductible this year so you can donate again in 2013! </p>

	<p>If you want to make a pledge of support to my run you can print out the attached pledge form and return it or email it to me Wilson High School. If you would prefer to just pledge a lump sum you can do so at wilsonfields.org using our PayPal account. Under "Add Special Instructions" on PayPal write in "Run for the Field". </p>

	<p>If you want to offer up  some incentives for me to run more laps to get more money put it out there and I will go as long as I can. What I really hope is each person who contributes will encourage others to join in as well. On the day of the run I would like to see students, staff and community members come out and run with me as a show of support even if you can't donate money to the cause…just don't expect me to be running really fast!</p>

	<p>Have a wonderful and restful winter break!</p>
	<p>Principal Chatard</p>
