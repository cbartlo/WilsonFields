			<h4>Wilson High School Field of Dreams</h4>

			<p><b>Portland, Ore.</b>, - Wherever there has been space to play, the history of genuine athletic success has always been found on the level playing fields of the past and thanks to the donations and efforts of hundreds of volunteers, the Wilson community will seek to continue this historical precedent with the Wilson Fields Improvement Project.
			</p>
			<p>The Wilson Fields Improvement Project will seek extensive community involvement as it aims to replace the existing natural grass of Wilson Field with a synthetic all-weather turf that will be open to the community for use, reduce year-round maintenance costs and ensure the opportunity of healthy, safe and successful play with a pristine surface resistant to the ravages of Oregon weather. The project will also include renovation of the existing field areas used for high jump, long jump, pole vault and shot put.
			</p>
			<p>Under the Places for Sport project, which is supported by Nike, Portland Public Schools, The City of Portland, and other community partners to provide high quality fields and tracks at Portland High Schools, the Wilson Fields Improvement Project is building on similar successful field renovation projects at other Portland area high schools such as Cleveland, Roosevelt, Lincoln, Franklin (in progress), and Grant (in progress). Partners, such as Nike and City of Portland, have contributed over $1,000,000 each towards these projects thus far, and PPS Great Fields Fund has contributed over $700,000.  $77,000 has been allocated so far from the PPS Great Fields Fund for this project and Nike is continuing to support the Wilson, Madison, and Franklin projects with staff expertise and support. This money will be applied towards the estimated $1.2 million cost for the main phase of the project.  As a non-profit organization, the Wilson Fields Improvement Project will rely heavily on the donations of those both in the Wilson community as well as those wishing to contribute to the project.
			</p>
			<p>The Wilson community will enjoy a year-round playing field, the promotion of safer and healthier play with the creation of a new and level field, and the potential for a positive economic impact on surrounding businesses from those who come to use the field or enjoy an athletic event as a spectator.
			</p>
			<p>The Wilson Fields Improvement Project is seeking to achieve their fundraising goal by May, 2013 and complete the program by August, 2013.
