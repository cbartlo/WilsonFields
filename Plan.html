	<h2>Plan</h2>
	<p>We also have a greater vision for the improvement of additional facilities on the Wilson High School campus in subsequent phases.
	These improvements include (not in specific order) artificial turf on the practice field and on the adjacent Reike Elementary school field; upgrading the announcers/score box in the stadium; and a new or upgraded concession area also in the Wilson stadium.
	Other upgrades to the parking lot and associated infrastructure may also be included as necessary or required by code or city ordinance.
	We expect these additional phases to be prioritized and planned as the first phase of construction comes closer to completion.
