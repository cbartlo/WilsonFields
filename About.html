	<h2>About Us: </h2>
	<p>Under the Places for Sport project, which is supported by Portland Public Schools and community partners to provide high quality fields and tracks at Portland High Schools, the Wilson Fields Improvement Project is building on similar successful field renovation projects at other Portland area high schools such as Cleveland, Roosevelt, Lincoln, Franklin (in progress), and Grant(in progress).
	So far, $77,000 has been allocated from the PPS Great Fields Fund.
	This money will be applied towards the estimated $1.2 million cost for the main phase of the project.  
	As a non-profit organization, the Wilson Fields Improvement Project will rely heavily on the donations of those both in the Wilson community as well as those wishing to contribute to the project.
	</p>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>The mission of the Wilson Field Improvement Project committee is to plan and fund raise in conjunction with key partners -Portland Public Schools, Portland Parks and Recreation and the City of Portland- to upgrade the playing surface on our main stadium field from natural grass to artificial field turf.  We plan to complete our fund raising and project planning by the spring of 2013. Our goal for project completion is before the start of the 2013 school year.  We also have a greater vision for the improvement of additional facilities on the Wilson High School campus in subsequent phases.  These improvements include (not in specific order) artificial turf on the practice field and on the adjacent Reike Elementary school field; upgrading the announcers/score box in the stadium; and a new or upgraded concession area also in the Wilson stadium.
	Other upgrades to the parking lot and associated infrastructure may also be included as necessary or required by code or city ordinance.
	We expect these additional phases to be prioritized and planned as the first phase of construction comes closer to completion.
	</p>
	<h2>Benefits of improving the fields</h2>
	<p>The Wilson Field Improvement committee sees a number of benefits from these upgrades.
	The first benefit will be increased ACCESS to the facility by both high school and community sporting groups.
	A turf field will be open year round to play by youth soccer, lacrosse, track and field and football groups.
	Local access to an all weather field will reduce the need for area teams to travel across Portland for their sporting events reducing driving, carbon emissions, traffic and subsequently improving the local use of currently affected fields at Lincoln HS, Cleveland HS, Benson HS and Delta Park to name a few who absorb our athletes and teams.
	Wilson HS has adequate parking for large events and is conveniently located for patrons to shop, eat, bank or to pick up a coffee before a game.
	We expect to see an economic benefit from the increased use of the Wilson fields for local businesses in Hillsdale and Multnomah Village as was previously mentioned.
	The high school will be the biggest beneficiary though.  A state of the art Wilson stadium will bring a new level of excitement to the athletes who suit up to represent Wilson High School and for the community and Alumni who support us.
	Wilson will join the rest of the schools in the area in having the ability to use their field year round for sports but also for the school's physical education programs and club sports.
